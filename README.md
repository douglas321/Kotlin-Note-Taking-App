# Overview

In order to improve as a software engineer I am challenging myself to create simple projects in various new programming languages. The hope is that I will be able to solidify my understanding of basic programming as well as familiarize myself with new languages.

This is an in terminal not taking application programmed in the Kotlin language. This program was written with the specific goal of demonstrating the basics of the Kotlin language and to demonstrate what I have learned in this short sprint of learning.

# Development Environment

For this project I used Intellij Idea. I decided to use this IDE because with just a quick download of the most recent version of Java I was able to program in Kotlin. Creating new Kotlin projects using Idea is very simple which was appealing to a beginner with the tool like me. 

I used the Kotlin language which is a language developed by JetBrains designed to operate with Java. Kotlin supports both object-oriented and functional programming.

# Future Work

- Read and Write from a file in order to save and load notes
- Date stamp the notes when they are created/edited
- Create a way to edit/add to notes without having to retype what was previously saved.
